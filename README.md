I worked on a game with my friend, Quynh, for a class assignment. We used Pygame to build it, and the goal is to arrange the puzzle 3x3 pieces to match the required pattern.
This was our final submission for grading in class. We did our best to fix the bugs, but there might still be some minor issues. Hope you have fun playing it!
